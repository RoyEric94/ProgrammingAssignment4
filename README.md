# Programming Assignment Week 4

This repository contains the script to modify the datasets provided in the class (Not included in the repo as the files are too big)

The script is split into 5 sections, one section per required task. Comments in the code itself explain each section and where each section begins

In order to function, the UCI Folder must be located in the folder where this file is located.

The Step4.txt file contains the tidy dataset containing the mean and std columns with the column names properly applied. The Activity label is also included in the dataset

The Step5.txt file contains the summarized data. It contains the average value of each column in the Step4 dataset grouped by Subject and Activity
